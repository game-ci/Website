# Container Hooks

Custom docker container steps can be run as part of the standard build workflow. Custom steps can
also be run standalone.

Custom steps can be specified via the CustomSteps parameter or via Custom Step files.

```yaml
- name: upload
  image: amazon/aws-cli
  commands: |
    echo "hello world!"
```
