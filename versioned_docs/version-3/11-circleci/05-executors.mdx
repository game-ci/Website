# Executors

The Orb provides reusable execution environments for you to run your jobs on. The executors
available are [macOS](#macos), [macOS on Runner](#macos-runner), [Windows](#windows),
[Windows on Runner](#windows-runner), [Ubuntu on Docker](#ubuntu)

The `macos` and `windows` executors take longer to setup due to the installation of external
dependencies. This can be mitigated using their [Runner](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview)
variants. As Runner doesn't share the ephemeral nature of the CircleCI cloud executors, the external
dependencies will already be installed after the first run, decreasing the environment preparation
time.

Notice that projects using `IL2CPP` as the
[scripting backend](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scripting-backends.html) should run on the same
OS as the [build target](/docs/circleci/build#build-target). For example, if you want to build for
macOS using `IL2CPP`, you must use the [macos](#macos) or [macos-runner](#macos-runner) executors.
For other use-cases, it's recommended to use [ubuntu](#ubuntu) for all supported platforms as it
will be cheaper and faster.

### macos

This executor uses the
[macOS cloud executor](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#macos) and it's recommended
for **macOS IL2CPP builds**. As there are no GameCI images for macOS at the moment, the Unity Editor
and Hub are installed in runtime, leading to longer build times. Should it become an issue, consider
using [macos-runner](#macos-runner) instead.

#### editor_version

Choose the Unity Editor version that you want to use to build your project. The options available
can be found on the Unity [archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos'
            editor_version: '2021.3.2f1'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

#### resource_class

Choose the
[resource class](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#macos-execution-environment) for
your execution environment. Try increasing it if your environment is running out of memory during
the build.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos'
            resource_class: 'large'
```

- _Default_: `medium`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `Enum`

#### xcode_version

Choose the [xcode version](https://circleci.com/docs/using-macos#supported-xcode-versions) for your
execution environment.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos'
            xcode_version: '14.0.0'
```

- _Default_: `13.4.1`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `String`

### macos-runner

This executor uses [self-hosted runner](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview). If you are
unsure how to create or configure it, follow  
[Installing Self-Hosted Runners with the Web App](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-installation) and
[CircleCI Self-hosted Runner Installation on macOS](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-installation-mac).

The `macos-runner` is an excellent alternative over [macos](#macos) to build macOS IL2CPP with
faster build times. Its non-ephemeral nature saves times on installing external dependencies after
the first run. And in addition, you are free to use an agent with hardware exceeding the
[available](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#macos-execution-environment) for the
web macOS executor.

#### editor_version

Choose the Unity Editor version that you want to use to build your project. The options available
can be found on the Unity [archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos-runner'
            editor_version: '2021.3.2f1'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

#### resource_class

Enter your [runner resource class](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview). If you are unsure
what this means, navigate to the beginning of this [sub-section](#macos-runner).

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos-runner'
            resource_class: 'my_runner_resource_class'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

#### working_directory

Enter the working directory of your runner agent. This will be where the job steps will run.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos-runner'
            working_directory: '/var/opt/circleci/unity_working_dir'
```

- _Default_: `/var/opt/circleci/workdir`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `String`

### ubuntu

This executor uses the
[Docker cloud executor](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#docker) with GameCI
[images](/docs/docker/docker-images). Since the latter ships with the Unity Hub, Editor and all
necessary dependencies, none of it is installed in runtime - making `ubuntu` more time-efficient
than [macos](#macos) and [windows](#windows).

For faster and cheaper runs, use it for all [build targets](/docs/circleci/build#build-target) that
don't require a host OS other than Linux.

#### editor_version

Choose the Unity Editor version that you want to use to build your project. The available options
can be found on the [versions](/docs/docker/versions) page.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            editor_version: '2021.3.2f1'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

#### resource_class

Choose the
[resource class](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#docker-execution-environment) for
your execution environment. Try increasing it if your environment is running out of memory during
the build.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos'
            resource_class: 'large'
```

- _Default_: `medium`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `Enum`

#### target_platform

Choose the target platform to be used for the GameCI image. The available options can be found on
the [versions](/docs/docker/versions) page.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/macos'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `Enum`

### windows

This executor uses the
[Windows cloud executor](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#available-windows-machine-images)
with GameCI [images](/docs/docker/docker-images) and it's recommended for **Windows IL2CPP builds**.
Due to [limitations](/docs/docker/windows-docker-images#limitations), jobs running on the Windows
executor must install third-party dependencies in runtime, leading to longer build times. Should it
become an issue, consider using [windows-runner](#windows-runner) instead.

The orb ships with three variants:
[windows-2019](https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/windows-server-2019),
[windows-2019-cuda](https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/windows-server-2019-cuda) and
[windows-2022](https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/windows-server-2022-gui). If you are
unsure of which one to use, pick `windows-2022`. If you need an executor with GPU, then choose
`windows-2019-cuda`.

#### editor_version

Choose the Unity Editor version that you want to use to build your project. The available options
can be found on the [versions](/docs/docker/versions) page.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:

            ## or name: "unity/windows-2019-cuda"
            editor_version: '2021.3.2f1'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

#### size

Choose the [size](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#windows-execution) of your
execution environment resource class. Try increasing it if your environment is running out of memory
during the build.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            name: 'unity/windows-2022'
            ## or name: "unity/windows-2019"
            ## or name: "unity/windows-2019-cuda"
            resource_class: 'xlarge'
```

- _Default_: `large`

            ## or name: "unity/windows-2019"
            ## or name: "unity/windows-2019-cuda"
            target_platform: 'windows-il2cpp'
```

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `Enum`

### windows-runner

This executor uses [self-hosted runner](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview). If you are
unsure how to create or configure it, follow  
[Installing Self-Hosted Runners with the Web App](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-installation) and
[CircleCI Self-hosted Runner Installation on Windows](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-installation-windows).

The `windows-runner` is an excellent alternative over [windows](#windows) to build Windows IL2CPP
with faster build times. Its non-ephemeral nature saves times on installing external dependencies
after the first run. And in addition, you are free to use an agent with hardware exceeding the
[available](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#windows-execution) for the web Windows
executor.
