# Android

Before `2018.4.8f1` for 2018 versions and before `2019.2.4f1` for 2019 versions, you will need a
specific Unity license (because that is not the same docker image). Add the content of your specific
Unity license in your CI's environment variable : `UNITY_LICENSE_CONTENT_ANDROID`. _This is not
required anymore now that images share a base image
[See related change](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d/merge_requests/63)_

By default the apk is not signed and the build will use the Unity's default debug key. For _security
reasons_, **you should not add your keystore to git**.

## Encode your keystore

Encode your keystore file as base64 using openssl:

```bash
openssl base64 -A -in yourKeystore.keystore
```

Copy the result to your CI's environment variable `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`

Add following environment variables:

- `KEYSTORE_PASS`: Keystore pass
- `KEY_ALIAS_NAME`: Keystore alias name to use (if not set, the program will use the alias name set
  in Project's PlayerSettings)
- `KEY_ALIAS_PASS`: Keystore alias pass to use

Note about _keystore security_, if you would like to use another solution for storage, see
[Where to Store Android KeyStore File in CI/CD Cycle?](https://android.jlelse.eu/where-to-store-android-keystore-file-in-ci-cd-cycle-2365f4e02e57).

### Android app bundle

`BUILD_APP_BUNDLE` env var is defined in `gitlab-ci.yml`. Set it to `true` to build an `.aab` file.
Note: to build an android app bundle, you need an image with **Android NDK**.

See [related issue gableroux/unity3d#61](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d/issues/61)

### Bundle version code

The bundle version code must be increment for each deployed build.

To simplify the process, the `BUNDLE_VERSION_CODE` env var is used and set as bundle version code.

Currently, for gitlab, `BUNDLE_VERSION_CODE = $CI_PIPELINE_IID`.
[Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)  
If you use another CI solution, set a CI env var incrementing for each pipeline.

### Fastlane supply (deployement)

Follow [setup instructions](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/) to get a google play
console token, then, add the content to env var `GPC_TOKEN`.

Uncomment the `#deploy-android` job in gitlab-ci.yml and replace `com.youcompany.yourgame` by your
package name.

You can change the track `internal` to `alpha`, `beta` or `production` (Note: if you are using the
`internal` track you will also have to mark your release as a draft in the `fastlane supply` command
using `--release_status draft`).

**Gemfile**

You will also need to add a Gemfile to your project to install the `fastlane` gem. Something like
the following:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
```

and then copy the file to the current directory prior to installing the gem. eg
`cp $CI_PROJECT_DIR/Gemfile .`.

That is the simplest way with command line but you can also make `fastlane/Fastfile` and
`fastlane/Appfile`, with the following command after building a temporary gradle project (export
gradle project option in Unity build settings):

```bash
fastlane init
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
fastlane supply init
```

and update all metadata, images, changelogs, etc... These will be uploaded to the store everytime.
Refer to [fastlane supply documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/) for more
details.
