# Tests

## Unity Tests

Unity supports two kinds of tests (`editmode` and `playmode`). The example project supports both.
More information and documentation concerning Unity tests can be found here:  
[Unity Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/index.html)

## Example Project Test files

Tests can be found here:

- [`editmode` tests in `Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests`](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests)
- [`playmode` tests in `Assets/Tests/`](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/blob/main/Assets/Tests/)

## Code coverage support

**TODO**, but we have support for this in example project. Let's not forget to update this section
accordingly :)
