# Getting started

The term for automatically testing, building, and deploying your project is Continuous Integration,
or CI for short.

The configuration for CI, we commonly call a CI-workflow.

To get started creating your workflow, you need 3 things:

- A Unity project
- A Git host (GitHub, GitLab, your private server, etc.)
- A CI system (GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines, CircleCI, TravisCI, Jenkins, etc.)

## Preparing the project

**Create a repository** on your chosen Git host and follow their instructions to commit and push
your project.

Be sure to **ignore any automatically generated files**, by adding the reference
[.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore) file to the root of
your project. Please note that you may have to extend this file by ignoring the temporary files created by the runners:

These temporary files may cause jobs to fail with the error message 'branch is dirty'. This error means that the local branch that the runner is using has uncommitted changes at that point during the build (more info [https://game.ci/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues#branch-is-dirty]).
Two common temporary folders that are created by gameci are `artifacts` and `CodeCoverage`. By adding these lines to your .gitignore, you can ignore their contents:

```
# Ignore temporaries from game-ci
/[Aa]rtifacts/
/[Cc]odeCoverage/
```

To **ensure large files are handled correctly** (in [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)), you can add
our reference
[.gitattributes](https://gist.github.com/webbertakken/ff250a0d5e59a8aae961c2e509c07fbc) file to the
root of your project.

You are now **ready** to create a workflow! Choose the CI system you chose in the menu on the left.
