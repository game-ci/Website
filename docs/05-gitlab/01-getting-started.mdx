# Getting started

This guide will demonstrate how to setup build and test automation for your Unity project hosted on
gitlab using gitlab-ci.

## Overall steps

1. Understand how [gitlab-ci](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/) works.
2. Configure a license for Unity.
3. Add build scripts and integrations in your Unity project
4. Set up a gitlab-ci pipeline for your project.
5. Result: Accept merge requests with more confidence.

## First time using Gitlab CI?

Read the official documentation about
[Getting started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/quick_start/).

Any subsequent steps assume you have read the above.

## Supported versions

The [unity3d-gitlab-ci-example project](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/) is
based on [unity3d](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/) docker images from
[game-ci](https://github.com/game-ci). Any version in the
[docker hub `unityci/editor` tags list](https://hub.docker.com/r/unityci/editor/tags) can be used to
test and build projects.

It's generally considered good practice to use the same Unity version for your CI/CD setup as you do
to develop your project.

:::caution

The video is slightly outdated, but the general concepts are still the same. üëç

- Activation process has changed a bit since then.
- Docker images have been updated
- The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file uses different variables now.

## Setting Up GitLab CI for Your Unity Project

Follow these steps to quickly set up GitLab CI for your Unity project.

### 1. Run the Commands

Open a terminal in the **parent folder** where you want to set up your Unity project and run these
commands one by one:

```bash
# Clone the example repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example.git

# Change to your Unity project folder
cd your-unity-project

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p Assets/Scripts/Editor/

# Copy required files from the example project
cp ../unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/.gitlab-ci.yml ./
cp -r ../unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/ci ./
cp ../unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/Assets/Scripts/Editor/BuildCommand.cs ./Assets/Scripts/Editor/
```

Replace `your-unity-project` with the name of your Unity project folder.

### 2. Customize the Configuration

1. **Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file**:

   - Open the copied `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your Unity project folder.
   - Update the Unity version and other variables. Your Unity version can be found in
     `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`.

2. **Update the `UNITY_DIR` variable**:
   - If your Unity project isn‚Äôt located at the root of your repository, update the `UNITY_DIR`
     variable in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to the relative path of your Unity project.

---

That‚Äôs It! Your Unity project is now set up for GitLab CI. **Proceed with activation instructions to
complete the process.**
