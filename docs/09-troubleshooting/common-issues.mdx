## Unity Activation

If you are having troubles with activation, you are not alone, this is a common problem, and it is
not the easiest thing to solve. Here are some tips:

- Try removing special characters from your password, sometimes they cause problems with command
  lines. _This is not a security advice_
- Your username should be an email
- Confirm you are able to connect on Unity's website using your credentials

**Unity no longer supports manual activation of Personal licenses**

When activating your Personal Unity license, you may encounter an issue where only the "Unity Pro or
Plus" option is available, preventing the activation of a Personal license. Here is a workaround to
resolve this:

1. Visit [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) and upload the
   `Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf` file.
2. On the "Activate your license" page, if the "Personal" option is not available, right-click on
   the page and choose "Inspect" to open the browser's developer tools.
3. Find the line of HTML that looks like this:
   `<div class="option option-personal clear" style="display: none;">`.
4. Delete `display: none;` from the `style` attribute to make the "Personal" option visible.
5. Now you should be able to select the "Personal" option and proceed with the activation.

You can discuss this issue or find additional assistance in the
[related Discord conversation](https://discord.com/channels/710946343828455455/1138586951604248666)
or [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/game-ci/documentation/issues/408).

_For future reference, activating a license from the command line as documented on
[Unity's Manual Page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagingYourUnityLicense.html) might be an
alternative solution._

:::caution Known issue with Unity activation on gitlab-ci: empty license file

If you are having troubles with Unity activation with gitlab-ci, there is currently an issue with
recent Unity versions preventing us to retrieve a license file with actual content.

For more details see the
[following issue: get-activation-file succeeding but giving a 0kb file. Unity Version 2021.2.7f1](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/issues/171)

### I cannot activate because

#### 'Non-whitespace before first tag. Line: 0 Column: 1 Char: „ºº' during manual activation

When activating a license on [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/), you may encounter
the following error message:

> Non-whitespace before first tag. Line: 0 Column: 1 Char: „ºº

Here's Unity's workaround:

> Unfortunately, this is a known issue our end. The relevant team are in the process of working on a
> fix as we speak, in the meantime there is a workaround. Try renaming the `alf` file with a command
> to convert characters on it with a `iconv` command.

##### Solution

```bash
version=v2020.1.12f1 # update this according to your version and file name
iconv -f UTF-8 -t utf-16BE Unity_${version}.alf > Unity_${version}.utf16be.alf
```

#### I use my Google account to login to Unity, how do I get my username and password?

If you are using google account you can have some issue with activating unity. You just need to go
on the unity website, settings, security and change your password. Then use your Google email and
your new password, and it will work just fine ;)

#### The digital signature is invalid.

##### Error

```plaintext
Error: Code 400 while processing request (status: Cannot save ULF license file: Validation failed. The digital signature is invalid.)
```

##### Solution

Depending on the CI/CD system, storing _multi-line_ file content into an environment variable can
break the encoding. You can store the license as a base64 encoded string. Then during the pipeline
execution, you decode it and write it to the right location afterward. For example, here is a fixed
confirmed to be working on OneDev CI:

```bash
/bin/echo $UNITY_LICENSE > /opt/project/Unity_v2022.x.base64 \
  && base64 -d /opt/project/Unity_v2022.x.base64 > /opt/project/Unity_v2022.x.ulf
```

## My workflow isn't working because

### I get `manifest for unityci/editor:2021.3.0f1-android-0 not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown`

This means the docker image trying to download from docker hub is not found.

#### Solution

To know which docker images are available, you can visit the list of [all supported Unity versions
here][unity-docker-versions].

In this particular case, it is also important to look for the last part of the docker image which is
the version for GameCI. `-0` means it is the latest `v0.x.x` version of the docker images. `v0.x.x`
and `v1.x.x` are out of date as we moved to Version 2 as shown on
[github.com/game-ci/docker/releases](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/releases). We are not
publishing images for `v0.x.x` or `v1.x.x` anymore.

The correct image should be `unityci/editor:2021.3.0f1-android-2`.

You can also test this locally:

```bash
# wrong
docker pull unityci/editor:2021.3.0f1-android-0
# Error response from daemon: manifest for unityci/editor:2021.3.0f1-android-0 not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown

# right
docker pull unityci/editor:2021.3.0f1-android-2
# 2021.3.0f1-android-2: Pulling from unityci/editor
# [...]
```

#### Github Actions

You need to make sure you are using Github Actions v3, check for the version of your actions in your
`.github/workflows/*.yml` files.

```diff
- uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
+ uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v3
```

#### Gitlab CI

Set the `IMAGE_VERSION` to 2 in
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/game-ci/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml#L12)

### Scripts have compiler errors.

#### Error

```plaintext
Scripts have compiler errors.
(Filename: ./Runtime/Utilities/Argv.cpp Line: 361)

Aborting batchmode due to failure:
Scripts have compiler errors.
```

#### Solution

Likely you have a missing script or assembly.

Make sure your branch is clean and all files are indeed present:

- No accidentally ignored files (i.e. ignored `.tmp` might match text mesh pro);
- No tracked files that you expected to be ignored;
- All packages listed;
- No pre-build steps that change your project differently from how that happens locally;

A good way to verify this, is to (locally) clone the Unity project in a new folder and run the build
from there.

### Branch is dirty

#### Error

```plaintext
Branch is dirty. Refusing to base semantic version on uncommitted changes
```

This usually happens with GitHub actions when using unity-builder. A dirty branch means that you
have uncommitted changes in your project. When you see this error in the logs of your pipeline, that
means some files of your project are being modified after the build. This is not desirable as it
could lead to unexpected results.

#### Solution

There are multiple options to solve this.

1. Ignore the dirty branch and continue the build. We have a parameter for that:
   [`allowDirtyBuild`](/docs/github/builder#allowdirtybuild) but ‚ö†Ô∏è it is not recommended.
2. Find the files that are being modified and fix the source of the problem. **This is the
   recommended solution**.

   The log should list the files that are considered modified on the now dirty branch. First, double
   check that these are not temporary files created by the runners themselves (see the
   [Preparing the Project](/docs/getting-started/#preparing-the-project) section regarding
   `.gitignore`). If the files are instead project related, locate the modified files and figure out
   why they are being modified. Sometimes, it's because a `.meta` file gets modified by unity when
   you open the project. If this is the case you can try this:

   1. Clone your project in a new folder
   2. Open your project with unity
   3. Build your project
   4. Run `git status` and see if files were modified. If so, commit them.

   You can also try to download the modified files from the pipeline by exposing them as artifact
   and looking at the diff yourself.

   Something else you can try is moving and committing the file(s) to see if it makes a difference.

### Gradle error

#### Error

```plaintext
Error: 3.690 [ERROR] [org.gradle.launcher.daemon.server.DaemonStateCoordinator] Command execution: started DaemonCommandExecution[command = Build{id=69dbd5b3-10f2-488e-8640-977da68733f9, currentDir=/github/workspace/Temp/gradleOut/launcher}, connection = DefaultDaemonConnection: socket connection from /127.0.0.1:33657 to /127.0.0.1:43866] after 0.0 minutes of idle
```

#### Solution

There are 2 possible solutions:

- Remove emojis from all environment variables (and thus workflow files), or
- Upgrade your project and workflow to use Unity editor version 2020.2 or later.

### No space left on device

#### Error

```plaintext
docker: failed to register layer: ApplyLayer exit status 1 stdout:  stderr: write /opt/unity/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib64/clang/9.0.8/lib/linux/x86_64/libFuzzer.a: no space left on device.
```

#### Solution

The GitHub-hosted runners often do not have enough disk space for game dev projects. To work around
this limitation, you could try to use the
[Free Disk Space (Ubuntu)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/free-disk-space-ubuntu) action at
the start of your workflow. If you still require additional disk space for your project, you could
try using
[Self-hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
or using
[Cloud Runners](https://game.ci/docs/github-cloud-runner/game-ci-vs-cloud-runner#large-github-projects).

## General tips

These are tips that are usually applicable to problems you may encounter while working with a game
engine and CI/CD:

- Try to isolate your problem as much as possible
- Try with a blank project, this will help you to isolate your problem. Is it a something with your
  project specifically or is it with Unity or GameCI?
- Try to search for error keywords in your message such as `error`, `failed`, `exception`, etc.
- Read the error message closely to understand what's going on.
