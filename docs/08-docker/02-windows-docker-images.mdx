# Windows docker images

Windows images are used for some features available only in windows. The main reason is usually
building an IL2CPP version of the application.

To build applications effectively in terms of build time, the very base image is a .NET framework
4.8. It's cached on GitHub actions runners and we truly need .NET. The base Windows image can be
found in
[https://github.com/game-ci/docker](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/blob/main/images/windows/base/Dockerfile).

## Features

- Git
- Choco package manager

## Limitations

### Microsoft does not allow redistribution of Visual Studio build tools

Microsoft does not permit publishing images with VS Build tools which are needed for IL2CPP builds
[`discussion`](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/issues/102#issuecomment-827170844).

You will encounter exceptions in the Unity log similar to
`error: Could not set up a toolchain for Architecture x64. Make sure you have the right build tools installed for il2cpp builds.`

```
error: Could not set up a toolchain for Architecture x64. Make sure you have the right build tools
installed for il2cpp builds. Details: IL2CPP C++ code builder is unable to build C++ code. In order
to build C++ code for Windows Desktop, you must have one of these installed: * Visual Studio 2022 or
newer with C++ compilers and Windows 10 SDK (recommended) * Visual Studio 2019 with C++ compilers and
Windows 10 SDK * Visual Studio 2017 with C++ compilers and Windows 10 SDK * Visual Studio 2015 with
C++ compilers and Windows 10 SDK Visual Studio 2017 (or newer) is detected using `vswhere.exe` as well
as VSCOMNTOOLS environment variables. Visual Studio 2015 is detected by looking at "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0_Config\InstallDir"
in the registry as well as VSCOMNTOOLS environment variables. Windows 10 SDK is detected by looking
at "SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0\InstallationFolder" in the registry.
Unable to detect any compatible Visual Studio installation! * Found Visual Studio 2022 installation
without C++ tool components Windows 10 SDK is not installed. You can install from here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/
```

</details>

There are two options to avoid this obstacle:

1. (_Recommended_) Inject/mount Microsoft Visual Studio with VC++ and Windows 10 SDK from the host
   system into the container during runtime.
2. Build a custom image and push it to a docker registry.

#### Option 1. Injecting VC++ from the host system into the container

> These instructions have been validated with Visual Studio 2022 and Unity 2021 LTS.

_Install Visual Studio Build Tools_

The recommended way to install the correct dependencies on the host is with
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). This works with Windows 10/11, Windows Server, and Windows
Server Core.

```powershell
choco install visualstudio2022-workload-vctools --no-progress -y
```

There is a way to install the same dependencies from the graphical
[Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), but the workload component
options in the installer frequently change.

_The following directories need to be bind-mounted into the container_

- C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
- C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
- C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio

> Please confirm all of the above directories exist in your installation. Some may be missing and
> things might still work OK without them. Omit the missing directories in the following steps.

_Docker run example_

```powershell
docker run `
  -v "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits:C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits" `
  -v "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio:C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio" `
  -v "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio:C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio"
  -v "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio:C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio" `
  unityci/editor:windows-$env:UNITY_VERSION-windows-il2cpp-$env:UNITY_IMAGE_VERSION
```

_Gitlab runner config.toml example_

```toml
#...
volumes = [
  "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits",
  "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio:C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio",
  "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio",
  "C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio:C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio"
]
#...
```

#### Option 2. Building a custom image

```dockerfile
ARG UNITY_VERSION=''
ARG UNITY_IMAGE_VERSION='3'

FROM unityci/editor:windows-${UNITY_VERSION}-windows-il2cpp-${UNITY_IMAGE_VERSION}

RUN choco install visualstudio2022-workload-vctools --no-progress -y
```

### Licenses are not valid between containers runs

This behaviour is different to Ubuntu containers where it's possible to use a single license for
even a few different runners.

In Windows, it's necessary to acquire a license every time and return it after a building process.
License files for every run are identical apart from the last four symbols of the machine hash code.
This restriction has not been solved yet

#### Scripting example

The simplest way is to write a couple of scripts (copied from
[`Unity3d docs`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagingYourUnityLicense.html)) and wrap it to the
try-finally block

**Note**: Path to Unity3d is
`C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\{UNITY_EDITOR_VERSION}\Editor\Unity.exe`

```powershell
try {
  build.ps1
} finally {
  return-license.ps1
}
```

#### GitLab example

```

        | Out-Host
      }
      finally {
        & $env:UNITY_EXECUTABLE `
        -quit `
        -batchmode `
        -nographics `
        -logFile - `
        -username $env:UNITY_USERNAME `
        -password $env:UNITY_PASSWORD `
        -returnlicense `
        | Out-Host
      }
```

## Troubleshooting: GitLab

### Gitlab doesn't have (or has few) shared docker-windows runners

There is no other option right now, but
[use a private runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/). Please, set the `docker-windows`
type of the runner

Default docker-for-windows settings are very resource-mean. It uses a single core and 1Gb of RAM.
That's why the custom configuration is highly recommended

**config.toml**

```toml
#...
[runners.docker]
  cpus = "12"
  memory = "13g"
  hostname = "dockerImage"
#...
```

**Note:** `hostname` doesn't influence the performance, but one day can help with license
association to a machine

### Default shell for GitLab Runner is PowerShell Core

GitLab Runner changed the default docker-windows executor shell in v14 to PowerShell Core which is a
newer version of PowerShell than is distributed with base windows container images.

There are two workarounds:

1. (_Recommended_) Manually specify the shell in the config to be the pre-v14 default.
2. Build a custom image including PowerShell Core and push it to a docker registry.

_Option 1: Change it in the `config.toml`_

```toml
[[runners]]
  shell = "powershell"
```

_Option 2: Install PowerShell Core_

```dockerfile
ARG UNITY_VERSION=''
ARG UNITY_IMAGE_VERSION='3'

FROM unityci/editor:windows-${UNITY_VERSION}-windows-il2cpp-${UNITY_IMAGE_VERSION}

RUN choco install pwsh --no-progress -y
```

Then push it to a docker registry. Installing `pwsh` during a pipeline doesn't help.

### Git-ssh dependency package checkout fails

The base image `windowsservercore` is too old and has some outdated packages. One of them, `OpenSSH`
has [a bug](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1263) that breaks the remote
repository signature check.

The best option here is to replace it with something more recent

```powershell
# Manually remove an old ssh-agent service
sc.exe delete ssh-agent
choco install openssh -params '"/SSHAgentFeature"' --no-progress -y
$env:GIT_SSH="C:\Program Files\OpenSSH-Win64\ssh.exe"
```

**Note:** `ssh-add` must be used from a different location,
`C:\Program Files\OpenSSH-Win64\ssh-add.exe`
