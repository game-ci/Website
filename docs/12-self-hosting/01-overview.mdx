# Overview

Projects often encounter a constraint or requirement which makes free-tier hosted CI/CD runners
insufficient for their needs. In these cases hosting your own CI/CD runner can be a viable
alternative to premium-tier services or subscriptions. Self-hosting may also provide access to
resources that are simply not available on many CI/CD services such as GPUs, faster drives, and
newer CPU models.

This guide will cover basic methods for hosting CI/CD runners on Bare-Metal, Virtual Machines, or
using Cloud Runner. Containerized hosts will not be discussed because of their inherent reliance on
insecure practices such as
[Docker-in-Docker](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/),
[Privileged Containers](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_th/research/19/l/why-running-a-privileged-container-in-docker-is-a-bad-idea.html)
and the additional tooling required to mitigate those risks such as
[Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) or
[Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/).

## üìö Prerequisite Knowledge

Users of this guide should already be familiar with the Linux command-line, Shell scripting, and
have a basic grasp of CI/CD concepts. For users who are not familiar with these concepts, we have
included some resources for you to start your learning journey below.

- [Techworld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana)
- [DevOps Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/@DevOpsToolkit)
- [Introduction to Bash Scripting](https://itsfoss.com/bash-scripting-tutorial/)

## üìã Constraints

There are many ways to self-host CI/CD runners, and which one is best for you will depend on your
own situation and constraints. For the purpose of this guide we will make the following assumptions:

- üíª User already has their own hardware
- üí∏ Budget for new hardware, software, or services is $0
- üõ†Ô∏è FOSS tools should be prioritized where possible
- üìú We define `Self-Hosting` in this context to refer to a user taking responsibility for the
  operating-system level configuration and life-cycle-management of a given compute resource (metal,
  on-prem, cloud VM, VPS etc...)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

This guide strives to maintain a balance between convenience and security for the sake of usability.
The examples included in this guide are intended for use with on-prem hardware without public IP
addresses accessible from external networks. Security is a constantly moving target which requires
continuous effort to maintain. Users should conduct their own security review before using the
following techniques on production or public systems.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Power Costs

Hosting your own runners also comes with an increase in power consumption. This will vary based on
the hardware you use and the prices of energy in your area. Below are some useful resources for
discovering the potential energy costs of self-hosting.

## üíª System Requirements

This guide is tested on devices which meet the following requirements:

- x86 or amd64 processor
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server or Debian 12 Bookworm
- Root access to the operating system
- Network connectivity

## üìé Quick Links:

### Host Creation

"Host Creation" in this context is the process of installing an operating system onto a piece of
physical hardware, or the creation and configuration of virtualised compute resources.

- [Bare-Metal](./03-host-creation/02-bare-metal.mdx)
- [Virtual Machines using Multipass](./03-host-creation/02-multipass.mdx)
- [Virtual Machines using QEMU](./03-host-creation/03-QEMU/01-overview.mdx)

### Host Provisioning

"Provisioning" here refers to the process of installing additional resources onto, and the
configuration of your host beyond installing the base operating-system. Both manual and declarative
workflows are supported.

- [Manual Ubuntu 22.04 Setup](./04-host-provisioning/02-ubuntu-setup.mdx)
- [Manual Debian 12 Setup](./04-host-provisioning/01-debian-setup.mdx)
- [Declarative provisioning via Cloud-Init](./04-host-provisioning/03-cloud-init.mdx)

### Runner Application Installation

Once your host has been provisioned, you will then need to install the appropriate runner
application. The guides below will walk you through that process.

- [Github Actions](./05-runner-application-installation/02-github-actions.mdx)
- [GitLab Pipelines](./05-runner-application-installation/01-gitlab-pipelines.mdx)
