_You can specify input parameters via any of the following methods._

- **GitHub Action `with`** _See "Getting Started" examples._
- **Command Line** _You can specify input parameters via command line._
- **Environment Variables** _You can specify input parameters via environment variables._
- **Configuration Override** _[Advanced Topics / Overrides](advanced-topics/configuration-override)_

## Modes

Cloud Runner can accept a parameter to run a specific mode, by default cli-build is run.

```bash
cli-build
```

_runs a cloud runner build_

```bash
list-resources
```

_lists active resources_

```bash
list-worfklow
```

_lists running workflows_

```bash
watch
```

_follows logs of a running workflow_

```bash
garbage-collect
```

_runs garbage collection_

```bash
- cache-push
- cache-pull
```

Cache commands to push and pull from the local caching directory. Used in cloud runner workflows.
Uses `cachePullFrom` and `cachePushTo` parameters.

```bash
- hash (hash folder contents recursively)
- print-input (prints all input parameters)
```

Utility commands

```bash
- remote-cli-pre-build (sets up a repository, usually before a game-ci build)
- remote-cli-post-build (pushes to LFS and Library cache)
```

Commands called during cloud runner workflows before/after a build.

## Common Parameters

### Git syncronization parameters

```bash
gitPrivateToken (should be a GitHub access token with permission to get repositories)
```

Used to authenticate remote job's access to repository.

```bash
- GITHUB_REPOSITORY
- GITHUB_REF || branch || GitSHA
```

Used to syncronize the repository to the Cloud Runner job. If parameters are not provided, will
attempt to read them from current directory's git repo (e.g branch, commit SHA, remote URL).

### Cloud Runner parameters

```bash
providerStrategy
```

Specifies the Cloud Provider to use for Cloud Runner jobs. Accepted values: `aws`, `k8s`,
`local-docker`.

```bash
- containerCpu
- containerMemory
```

Specifies the CPU and Memory resources to be used for cloud containers created by Cloud Runner.
(See: getting started section for more configuration options per provider.)

```bash
cloudRunnerBranch
```

Specifies the release branch of Cloud Runner to use for remote containers. Accepted values: `main`
(default), `cloud-runner-preview` (stable/development), `cloud-runner-develop` (latest/development)

### Custom commands from files parameters

```bash
- containerHookFiles
- commandHookFiles
- commandHooks
- postBuildContainerHooks
- preBuildContainerHooks
```

Specifies the name of custom hook or step files to include in workflow. (Accepted Format: see
"[container hooks](advanced-topics/custom-hooks/container-hooks)
[command hooks](advanced-topics/custom-hooks/command-hooks)")

### Custom commands from yaml parameters

```bash
customJob
```

Specifies a custom job to override default build workflow. (Accepted Format: see
"[advanced topics / custom job](advanced-topics/custom-hooks/custom-job)")

### Configuration Override

```bash
inputPullCommand
```

Read parameter from command line ouput, such as a secret manager. Must include a `{0}` to inject the
name of the parameter to pull. (See:
[Configuration Override](advanced-topics/configuration-override))

```bash
pullInputList
```

List of parameters to apply with `inputPullCommand`. (See:
[Configuration Override](advanced-topics/configuration-override))

### Aws

```bash
awsStackName
```

Name of the persistent shared base stack, used to store artifacts and caching.

### K8s

```bash
- kubeVolume
- kubeVolumeSize
- kubeStorageClass
```

Override name of persistent volume used, size of volume and storage class used.

### Caching

```bash
cacheKey
```

Defaults to branch name. Defines the scope for sharing cache entries.

### Utility

```bash
- cloudRunnerDebug (Debug logging for Cloud Runner)
- useLargePackages (Any packages in manifest.json containing phrase "LargePackage" will be
  redirected to a shared folder for all builds sharing a cache key)
- useSharedBuilder (Use a shared clone of Game-CI, saves some storage space and can be used if
  you're using one release branch of Cloud Runner)
- useCompressionStrategy (Use Lz4 compression for cache and build artifacts. Enabled by default)
```

### Retained Workspace

```bash
- maxRetainedWorkspaces
```

See: [Advanced Topics / Retained Workspaces](advanced-topics/retained-workspace), enables caching
entire project folder.

### Garbage Collection

```bash
- garbageMaxAge
```

## Command Line Only Parameters

```bash
- populateOverride
- cachePushFrom
- cachePushTo
- artifactName
- select
```

## Other Environment Variables

```bash
- USE_IL2CPP (Set to `false`)
```
