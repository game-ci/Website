# AWS

## Requirements

- You must have an AWS account setup and ready to create resources.
- Create a service account and generate an AWS access key and key id.

## AWS Credentials

Setup the following as `env` variables for cloud runner to use:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (should be the same AWS region as the base stack e.g `eu-west-2`)

If you're using GitHub you can use a GitHub Action:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: eu-west-2
```

_Note:_ _This enables Cloud Runner access AWS._

## Configuration For AWS Cloud Runner Jobs

Refer to [Configuration page](../api-reference) or the [example below](#example).

### Allowed CPU/Memory Combinations

There are some limitations to the CPU and Memory parameters. AWS will only accept the following
combinations:
[AWS Fargate Documentation, Allowed CPU and memory values (Task Definitions)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size)

#### Summary Of Format

- Values are represented as 1024:1 GB or CPU.
- Do not include the vCPU or GB suffix.
- 1 CPU can go to a max of 6 GB of memory. 2 CPU's are required to go higher.

#### Valid CPU and Memory Values

```yaml
- cloudRunnerMemory: 4096
- cloudRunnerCpu: 1024
```

## Example

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-builder@cloud-runner-develop
  id: aws-fargate-unity-build
  with:
    providerStrategy: aws
    versioning: None
    projectPath: `your path here`
    unityVersion: `unity version here`
    targetPlatform: ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
    gitPrivateToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # You may want to export your builds somewhere external so you can access it:
    containerHookFiles: aws-s3-upload-build
```
