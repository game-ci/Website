# Performance

By sending the build to a cloud resource we must accept some overhead in time to do this. Cloud
Runner tries to manage and offer good solutions to cut down any overhead. As well as supporting you
to use all options to speed up common workflows, such as incremental builds.

## Warm start

⚠️Development roadmap for cloud runner feature: Will enable you to maintain a minimum number of
active build resources to handle incoming jobs with shorter delay times to start a job.

## Push Hooks

⚠️Development roadmap for cloud runner feature: Rather than starting a job from your CI process, you
can initally start a Cloud Runner job from your local git push hooks, the CI process can then catch
up and observe the logs as needed.

## Sidecar

⚠️Development roadmap for cloud runner feature: Continually stream changes to game-ci workloads
without needing to push or even commit explicitly (configurable).

## Caching

Caching is used to speed up git clones, Unity imports and builds and can be extended for custom
scenarios.

See [Caching](caching).

## Provider Platform's impact

The different Cloud Runner providers all offer different guarenetees and performance for handling
your workloads.
