# Test

The Unity Orb provides the
[test job](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#jobs-test) to facilitate the
process of testing your Unity project.

At the end of the run, the test results are parsed to JUnit and
[stored](https://circleci.com/docs/collect-test-data) in CircleCI so that
[test insights](https://circleci.com/docs/insights-tests) can be used. You can access test insights
from the CircleCI web app.

### Parameters

Below you will find information on each parameter that can be passed to the test job.

#### executor

The executor on which you want to run your test job on. Each executor has its set of parameters. See
the [Executors](/docs/circleci/executors) section for more details.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  test-unity-project:

### Examples

In this sub-section, you will find examples of workflows using this job. However, notice that the
separation used in the examples is for visualization's sake only. You can test for all test
platforms in the same workflow.

#### Personal License

Unity's personal license. If you are unsure what this means, navigate to the
[Activation](/docs/circleci/activation) section. All examples are based on CircleCI's
[Demo Project](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD).
