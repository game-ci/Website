# Test

The Unity orb provides the
[test job](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#jobs-test) to facilitate the
process of testing your Unity project. At the end of the run, the test results are parsed to JUnit
and [stored](https://circleci.com/docs/collect-test-data) in CircleCI to enable
[test insights](https://circleci.com/docs/insights-tests). You can access them from the CircleCI
Dashboard.

### Parameters

In this sub-section, you will find information on each parameter the job provides.

#### executor

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `Executor`

The executor on which you want to run your test job on. Each executor has its set of parameters. See
the [Executors](/docs/circleci/executors) section for more details.

### Examples

In this sub-section, you will find examples of workflows using this job. However, notice that the
separation used in the examples is for visualization's sake only. You can test for all test
platforms in the same workflow.

#### Personal License

Unity's personal license. If you are unsure what this means, navigate to the
[Activation](/docs/circleci/activation) section. All examples are based on CircleCI's
[Demo Project](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD).
