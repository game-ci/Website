# Getting started

This guide will help you test and build your Unity project using our
[Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity).

## Overall steps

1. Understand how CircleCI works.
2. Set up a workflow for your project.
3. Download the artifacts from your first build.

## CircleCI

If you are not familiar with CircleCI, read the official documentation on how to set up a
[workflow](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started). The following steps will assume you have done
so.

#### Unity Orb

[Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/) are reusable snippets of code that help automate repeated
processes, speed up project setup and make it easy to integrate with third-party tools.

To streamline the process of testing and building Unity projects in CircleCI, we provide the
[Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity) â€” a certified orb capable of
caching dependencies, storing artifacts, collecting test data and running on multiple
[executors](/docs/circleci/executors).

In the sections below, you will learn how to import and use the orb to test and build your project
for different target platforms.

_**Note:** the Orb is a work in progress. It doesn't have feature parity with our GitHub
[Builder Action](/docs/github/builder) yet._

## Activation

To build and test projects, you need an
[activated license](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LicensesAndActivation.html). The Unity Orb will
handle the activation process if you have all necessary environment variables set in the job's
context. If you proceed to [set up your workflow](#setting-up-a-workflow) without doing so, your job
will fail. For more details, head to the [Activation](/docs/circleci/activation) section.

## Setting up a workflow

Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in the root of your repository and follow these steps:

1. Import the [Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity) and fix it to a
   `minor` version (e.g. `1.16`) to avoid receiving updates with breaking changes:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y
```

2. Include a [build job](/docs/circleci/build) in your workflow and modify the
   [parameters](/docs/circleci/build#parameters) to accommodate your project needs:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          name: 'build-linux64-il2cpp'
          step-name: 'Build StandaloneLinux64'
          unity-license-var-name: 'UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE'
          unity-username-var-name: 'UNITY_USERNAME'
          unity-password-var-name: 'UNITY_PASSWORD'
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
            editor_version: '2021.3.1f1'
            resource_class: 'large'
          project-path: 'Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD/src'
          build-target: StandaloneLinux64
          compress: true
          context: unity
```

3. Optionally, include a [test job](/docs/circleci/test) in your workflow:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  test-and-build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/test:
          name: 'test-linux'
          step-name: 'Check if tests run and results are uploaded'
          unity-license-var-name: 'UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE'
          unity-username-var-name: 'UNITY_USERNAME'
          unity-password-var-name: 'UNITY_PASSWORD'
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
            editor_version: '2021.3.1f1'
            resource_class: 'medium'
          project-path: 'Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD/src'
          test-platform: 'playmode'
          context: unity
      - unity/build: ...
```

You can add it as a [requirement](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#requires) in the
build job to prevent it from running in case of failure:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  test-and-build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/test:
          name: 'test-linux'
          ...
      - unity/build:
          ...
          requires:
            - test-linux
```

4. Commit and push the new workflow.

## Downloading the artifacts

1. Navigate to your project in the CircleCI [web app](https://app.circleci.com/).

2. Identify the pipeline triggered by your changes and open the `build-linux64-il2cpp` job.

3. Navigate to the `ARTIFACTS` tab and download the `UnityBuild-StandaloneLinux64.tar.gz` file.

4. Extract the `UnityBuild-StandaloneLinux64.tar.gz` file and you will have your first build using
   the Unity Orb ðŸš€.
