# Getting started

This guide will help you test and build your Unity project using the
[Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity).

## Overall steps

1. Understand how [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started) works.
2. Set up a workflow for your project.
3. Add your Unity credentials and license to a context.
4. Result: Merge pull requests with more confidence.

## First time using CircleCI?

Read the official documentation on how to set up a
[workflow](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started). Subsequent steps will assume you have done
so.

#### Unity Orb

[Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/) are reusable snippets of code that help automate repeated
processes, speed up project setup, and make it easy to integrate with third-party tools.

To streamline the process of testing and building Unity projects in CircleCI, GameCI provides the
[Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity). A certified orb capable of
dependencies caching, artifacts storage, test data collection and macOS, Windows, Docker, Machine
and Runner support.

In further sections, you will learn how to import and use the orb to test and build your project for
several target platforms.

_**Note:** the orb is in the early stages of development; it doesn't have all features included in
the [Builder Action](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-builder)._

## Setting up a workflow

Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in the root of your repository and follow these steps:

1. Import the [Unity Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity). It's recommended
   to fix a `minor` or `patch` version to avoid unintended updates with breaking changes:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@1.0
```

2. Include a [build job](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#jobs-build) in your
   workflow:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@1.0

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          name: 'build-linux64-il2cpp'
          step-name: 'Build StandaloneLinux64'
          unity-license-var-name: 'UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE'
          unity-username-var-name: 'UNITY_USERNAME'
          unity-password-var-name: 'UNITY_PASSWORD'
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
            editor_version: '2021.3.1f1'
            resource_class: 'large'
          project-path: 'Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD/src'
          build-target: StandaloneLinux64
          compress: true
          context: unity
```

3. Optionally, include a [test job](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#jobs-test)
   in your workflow. You can add it as a
   [requirement](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#requires) in the build job above
   to prevent it from running in case of failure:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@1.0

workflows:
  test-and-build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/test:
          name: 'test-linux'
          step-name: 'Check if tests run and results are uploaded'
          unity-license-var-name: 'UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE'
          unity-username-var-name: 'UNITY_USERNAME'
          unity-password-var-name: 'UNITY_PASSWORD'
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
            editor_version: '2021.3.1f1'
            resource_class: 'medium'
          project-path: 'Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD/src'
          test-platform: 'playmode'
          context: unity
      - unity/build:
          name: 'build-linux64-il2cpp'
          step-name: 'Build StandaloneLinux64'
          unity-license-var-name: 'UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE'
          unity-username-var-name: 'UNITY_USERNAME'
          unity-password-var-name: 'UNITY_PASSWORD'
          executor:
            name: 'unity/ubuntu'
            target_platform: 'linux-il2cpp'
            editor_version: '2021.3.1f1'
            resource_class: 'large'
          project-path: 'Unity2D-Demo-Game-CI-CD/src'
          build-target: StandaloneLinux64
          compress: true
          context: unity
          requires:
            - test-linux
```

4. Set the `UNITY_USERNAME`, `UNITY_PASSWORD` and `UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE` environment variables in
   your organization's [context](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts). See the `Activation` section
   for instructions on how to get the `UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE` value.

5. Build your application.
