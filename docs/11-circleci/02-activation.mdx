# Activation

The orb uses a Unity Editor instance to test and build your projects. These operations require the
instance to be activated before each job you run.

Unity separates its licenses between `Personal` and `Professional`. The former applies to the _free_
and the latter to the _Pro_ and _Plus_ versions. Based on your use case proceed to the
[Personal](#personal-license) or [Professional](#professional-license) license section.

## Personal license

Follow these steps if you are using Unity's _free_ version.

> _**Note:** Do NOT follow the steps for the personal license if you have a professional license._

#### Mental model

1. Use the Unity Orb to create an activation file.
2. Use the activation file to acquire a license file from the Unity website.
3. Encode the license file and save it in a CircleCI Context.

#### Acquiring an activation file

Add the workflow below to a [project set up in CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started).
As long as you can access it in the CircleCI web app and download its artifacts, it can be any
project.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  create-unity-activation-file:
    jobs:
      - unity/create-activation-file
```

If you require an activation file for a specific version of the Unity Editor, you need to provide
its version number as an argument. The available versions can be found on our
[versions](/docs/docker/versions) page.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  create-unity-activation-file:
    jobs:
      - unity/create-activation-file:
          editor_version: 2022.1.11f1
```

Commit and push the new workflow and navigate to your project in the CircleCI web app. Identify the
pipeline triggered by your changes and open the `unity/create-activation-file` job. In the
`ARTIFACTS` tab, you will encounter `Unity.alf`; this is your activation file. Download it and
proceed to the following sub-section.

#### Acquiring the license file

1. Navigate to the [manual activation](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) page and upload the
   `Unity.alf` activation file.
2. Answer the prompted questions.
3. Download the license file (Unity_v20XX.x.ulf).

> _Note: It is fine if the version number in the file name does not match your exact Unity version._

#### Encoding the license

Encode the contents of your `Unity_v20XX.x.ulf` file to base64. If you have the `base64` command
line utility you can use:

```
cat Unity_v20XX.x.ulf | base64
```

#### Configuring your Context

1. Navigate to [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/) ⇢ `Organization Settings` ⇢ `Contexts` ⇢
   `Create Context` and choose a name for your context (e.g. `myProjectContext`). Alternatively,
   open an existing Context that you would like to use.
2. Create the following environment variables:
   - `UNITY_ENCODED_LICENSE` - _(Paste the content from the
     [Encoding the License](#encoding-the-license) section here)_
   - `UNITY_USERNAME` - _(Add the email address that you use to log in to Unity)_
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to log in to Unity)_
3. Remove or disable the job you included to acquire your activation file. It's no longer necessary.

> _**Note:** When changing the Unity version, you may need to repeat the same process._

## Professional license

Follow these steps if you are using Unity's _Pro_ or _Plus_ version.

> _**Note:** Do NOT follow the steps for the professional license if you have a personal license._

1. Get your Serial Key from the [subscriptions page](https://id.unity.com/en/subscriptions).
2. Navigate to [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/) ⇢ `Organization Settings` ⇢ `Contexts` ⇢
   `Create Context` and choose a name for your context (e.g. `myProjectContext`). Alternatively,
   open an existing Context that you would like to use.
3. Create the following environment variables:
   - `UNITY_SERIAL` - _(Paste the serial acquired in **step 1** here. It should look like this:
     `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)_
   - `UNITY_USERNAME` - _(Add the email address that you use to log in to Unity)_
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to log in to Unity)_

## Next steps

Now you are prepared to start [testing](/docs/circleci/test) and [building](/docs/circleci/build)
your Unity project. However, remember to reference your context in every job you run; otherwise,
they will fail:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/test:
          ...
          context: unity
      - unity/build:
          ...
          context: unity
```
