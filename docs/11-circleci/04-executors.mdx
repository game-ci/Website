# Executors

The orb provides reusable execution environments for you to run your jobs on. The executors
available are [macOS](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-macos),
[macOS on Runner](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-macos-runner),
[Windows](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-windows-2022),
[Windows on Runner](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-windows-runner)
and [Ubuntu on Docker](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-ubuntu).

Due to the installation of external dependencies, the `macos` and `windows` executors have longer
environment preparation times. This can be mitigated using their
[Runner](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview) variants. As Runner doesn't share the ephemeral
nature of the CircleCI cloud executors, the external dependencies will already be installed after
the first run, decreasing the environment preparation time.

Notice that projects using `IL2CPP` as the
[scripting backend](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scripting-backends.html) should run on the same
OS as the [build target](#build-target). For example, if you want to build for macOS using `IL2CPP`,
you must use the [macos](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-macos) or
[macos-runner](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/game-ci/unity#executors-macos-runner)
executors.

### macos

This executor uses the CircleCI
[macOS cloud executor](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#macos). It's recommended to
use it for macOS IL2CPP builds. The executor parameters are:

#### editor_version

- _Default_: `N/A`
- _Required_: `True`
- _Type_: `String`

Choose the Unity Editor version that you want to use to build your project. The options available
can be found on the Unity [archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            editor_version: '2021.3.2f1'
```

#### resource_class

- _Default_: `medium`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `enum`

Choose the
[resource class](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#macos-execution-environment) for
your execution environment. Try increasing it if your environment is running out of memory.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            resource_class: 'large'
```

#### xcode_version

- _Default_: `13.4.1`
- _Required_: `False`
- _Type_: `string`

Choose the [xcode version](https://circleci.com/docs/using-macos#supported-xcode-versions) for your
execution environment.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  unity: game-ci/unity@x.y

workflows:
  build-unity-project:
    jobs:
      - unity/build:
          executor:
            xcode_version: '14.0.0'
```
