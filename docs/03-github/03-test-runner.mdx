# Test runner

Running your test suite in an automated workflow helps increase certainty when merging.

Use [Unity - Test runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner) to run your Unity tests.

_Optional_ to include test coverage, use
[Unity - Code Coverage](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/index.html)

## Basic setup

By default, the test runner will run both `playmode` and `editmode` tests.

Create or edit the file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` and add a job to it.

#### Personal license

Personal licenses require a one-time manual activation step.

Make sure you
[acquire and activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file)
your license file and add it as a secret.

Then, define the test step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  env:
    UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Professional license

Make sure you have set up these variables in the activation step.

- `UNITY_EMAIL` (should contain the email address for your Unity account)
- `UNITY_PASSWORD` (the password that you use to login to Unity)
- `UNITY_SERIAL` (the serial provided by Unity)

Define the test step as follows:

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  env:
    UNITY_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
    UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
    UNITY_SERIAL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_SERIAL }}
  with:
    projectPath: path/to/your/project
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That is all you need to test your project.

## Viewing test results

The test results can be viewed from a [GitHub Status Check](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks).

To get this functionality, simply provide the [GitHub Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret)
in order to view the tests results from [a check run](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api#about-check-runs).

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If you choose not to provide the `githubToken`, you may still upload the artifacts in order to access them.

## Storing test results

To be able to access the test results, they need to be uploaded as artifacts.

To do this, it is recommended to use the official Github Actions
[upload artifact action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact).

By default, Test Runner outputs its results to a folder named `artifacts`.

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Test results
    path: artifacts
```

Test results can now be downloaded as `Artifacts` in the `Actions` tab.

#### Specifying artifacts folder

You can specify a different `artifactsPath` in the test runner and reference this path using the `id` of the test step.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  id: myTestStep
```

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Test results
    path: ${{ steps.myTestStep.outputs.artifactsPath }}
```

### Getting coverage results

The results for the test code coverage are stored in the folder `CodeCoverage` and the path
can be read by the step's `outputs.coveragePath`. These coverage options can be configured
as part of the test and by default will create an XML and HTML web page reports.

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    name: Coverage results
    path: ${{ steps.myTestStep.outputs.coveragePath }}
```

The coverage results will be generated for whatever tests were selected to run.
If both `editmode` and `playmode` are selected by using `all`, then the results
will have the combined coverage of both test modes.

_Note_ Coverage results are generated with root permission so to move or edit
the output in later steps you may need to use elevated permissions such as `sudo`.

## Caching

In order to make test runs (and builds) faster,
you can cache Library files from previous runs.

To do so, simply add Github Actions' official
[cache action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache)
before any unity steps.

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: path/to/your/project/Library
    key: Library-MyProjectName-TargetPlatform
    restore-keys: |
      Library-MyProjectName-
      Library-
```

This simple addition could speed up your test runs by more than 50%.

## Configuration options

Below options can be specified under `with:` for the `unity-test-runner` action.

#### unityVersion

Version of Unity to use for testing the project.
Use "auto" to get from your ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `auto`_

#### customImage

Specific docker image that should be used for testing the project.

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    customImage: 'unityci/editor:2020.1.14f1-base-0'
```

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `""`_

#### projectPath

Specify the path to your Unity project to be tested.
The path should be relative to the root of your project.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `<your project root>`_

#### customParameters

Custom parameters to configure the test runner.

For example, you may refer to the [Unity Test Framework command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/reference-command-line.html) for options that could help with configuring your tests.

Parameters must start with a hyphen (`-`) and may be followed by a value (without hyphen).

Parameters without a value will be considered booleans (with a value of true).

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
  with:
    customParameters: -profile SomeProfile -someBoolean -someValue exampleValue
```

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `""`_

#### testMode

The type of tests to be run by the test runner.

Options are: `All`, `PlayMode`, and `EditMode`.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `All`_

#### artifactsPath

Path where the test results should be stored.

In this folder a folder will be created for every test mode.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `artifacts`_

### coverageOptions

Options for configuring code coverage, this configures the `-coverageOptions`
parameter described unity's CodeCoverage documentation:
[Using Code Coverage in batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html).

By default, this parameter is configured to generate an HTML report with additional metrics.
This should be fine for most projects, but the webpage report can be quite large for projects
with hundreds or thousands of large files.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `generateAdditionalMetrics;generateHtmlReport;generateBadgeReport`_

#### useHostNetwork

Initializes Docker using the host network.

This is useful if Unity needs to access a local server that was started as part of your workflow.

Options are: "true", "false"

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `false`_

#### sshAgent

SSH Agent path to forward to the container.

This is useful if your manifest has a dependency on a private GitHub repo.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** ``_

#### gitPrivateToken

GitHub Private Access Token (PAT) to pull from GitHub.

This is useful if your manifest has a dependency on a private GitHub repo.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** ``_

#### githubToken

Token to authorize access to the GitHub REST API. If provided, a check run will be created with the test results.

It is recommended to use `githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`,
but creating the check from [a fork of your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token)
may require using a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).

Reference the [GitHub Checks API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks)
for details on [creating CI tests with the Checks API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-ci-tests-with-the-checks-api).

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** ``_

#### checkName

Name for the check run that is created when a github token is provided.

It may be useful to customize the check name if, for example, you have a job matrix with multiple unity versions.

_**required:** `false`_
_**default:** `Test Results`_

## Complete example

A complete workflow that tests all modes separately could look like this:

```yaml
name: Test project

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  testAllModes:
    name: Test in ${{ matrix.testMode }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-project
        testMode:
          - playmode
          - editmode
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}/Library
          key: Library-${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          restore-keys: |
            Library-
      - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
        id: tests
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          testMode: ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          artifactsPath: ${{ matrix.testMode }}-artifacts
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          checkName: ${{ matrix.testMode }} Test Results
          coverageOptions: 'generateAdditionalMetrics;generateHtmlReport;generateBadgeReport;assemblyFilters:+MyScripts'
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: Test results for ${{ matrix.testMode }}
          path: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.artifactsPath }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
