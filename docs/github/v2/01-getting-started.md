# Getting started

Unity Actions provide the fastest and **easiest** way to automatically test and build any Unity project.

There are a few parts to setting up a workflow. Steps may slightly differ depending on each license type.

## Mental model

#### Overall steps

1. Understand how
   [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
   work.
2. Configure a license for Unity.
3. Set up a workflow for your project.
4. Result: Merge pull requests with more confidence.

#### Setting up a workflow

Setting up a workflow is easy!

Create a file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository and configure the following steps;

1. Checkout your repository using
   [Checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).
2. Cache Unity Library folder using
   [Cache](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
3. Configure your test job using
   [Test Runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-test-runner).
4. Configure your build job using
   [Builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-builder).
5. Deploy your application.

_**Note:** all steps will be explained in the next chapters._

## Support

#### First time using GitHub Actions?

Read the official documentation on how to setup a
[workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow).

Any subsequent steps assume you have read the above.

#### Supported unity versions

Unity Actions are using
[game-ci/docker](https://github.com/game-ci/docker/)
since `unity-builder` version 2. Any version in this
[list](https://hub.docker.com/r/unityci/editor/tags)
can be used to test and build projects.

## Simple example

Below is a simple example. It is **recommended** to start from here.

This example assumes that your Unity project is in the root of your repository.

```yaml
name: Actions ðŸ˜Ž

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [main] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build my project âœ¨
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          lfs: true

      # Cache
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: Library
          key: Library

      # Test
      - name: Run tests
        uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2

      # Build
      - name: Build project
        uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
        with:
          targetPlatform: WebGL

      # Output
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```

## Advanced example

To get an idea of how to create a more advanced workflows,
have a look at the example below.

```yaml
name: Actions ðŸ˜Ž

on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [main] }

env:
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}

jobs:
  buildAndTestForSomePlatforms:
    name: Build for ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        projectPath:
          - test-project
        targetPlatform:
          - StandaloneOSX # Build a macOS standalone (Intel 64-bit).
          - StandaloneWindows64 # Build a Windows 64-bit standalone.
          - StandaloneLinux64 # Build a Linux 64-bit standalone.
          - iOS # Build an iOS player.
          - Android # Build an Android player.
          - WebGL # WebGL.
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          lfs: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}/Library
          key: Library-${{ matrix.projectPath }}-${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
          restore-keys: |
            Library-${{ matrix.projectPath }}-
            Library-
      - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
        id: testRunner
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: Test results (all modes)
          path: ${{ steps.testRunner.outputs.artifactsPath }}
      - uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
        with:
          projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
          targetPlatform: ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
          customParameters: '-myParameter myValue -myBoolean -ThirdParameter andItsValue'
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```
