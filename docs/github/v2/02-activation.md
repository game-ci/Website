# Activation

All actions use a Unity installation, which needs to be activated.

Unity differentiates their methods between `personal` and `professional` licenses.

Depending on whether you are using a free or paid version of Unity, you will need to follow the steps for either a [personal license](#personal-license) or a [professional license](#professional-license). 

## Personal license

Follow these steps if you are using a free version of Unity.

#### Mental model

1. Request an activation file for usage on GitHub
2. Use that file to acquire a license
3. Set the license as a secret

#### About the activation file

You may use the
[Unity - Request Activation File](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file)
action with the below instructions.

The activation file uses machine identifiers and the Unity version number.
All GitHub virtual machines emit the same hardware ID.
You cannot perform this step locally.

Let's go!

#### Acquiring an activation file

Create a file called `.github/workflows/activation.yml` and add the below workflow definition to it:

```yaml
name: Acquire activation file
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  activation:
    name: Request manual activation file
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Request manual activation file
      - name: Request manual activation file ğŸ”‘
        id: getManualLicenseFile
        uses: game-ci/unity-request-activation-file@v2
      # Upload artifact (Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf)
      - name: Expose as artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
          path: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
```

Commit and push your workflow definition.

#### Converting into a license

Follow these (one-time) steps for simple activation.

- [Manually run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) the above workflow. 
- Download the manual activation file that now appeared as an artifact.
- Visit [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) and upload it.
- You should now receive your license file (Unity_v20XX.x.ulf) as a download.
- Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets`.
- Create a secret called `UNITY_LICENSE` and copy the contents of your license file into it.

> _**Note:** When changing Unity version, you may need to repeat the same process._

## Professional license

1. Subscribe to Unity Plus or Unity Pro, and get your Serial Key from the [Unity Subscriptions page](https://id.unity.com/en/subscriptions)
2. Open `Github` > `<Your repository>` > `Settings` > `Secrets`
3. Create the following secrets;
   - `UNITY_SERIAL` - _(Add the serial key from step 1 that looks like `XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)_
   - `UNITY_EMAIL` - _(Add the email address that you use to login to Unity)_
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - _(Add the password that you use to login to Unity)_

> _**Note:** Do NOT follow the steps for the personal license if you have a professional license._

## Optional steps

- Verify your license using
  [Activate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-activate).
- When using a pro license also use
  [Return License](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-return-license)
  to free up the license allocation after usage.

> _**Note:** Test runner and Builder already include these steps._

## Next steps

The license can be used in test and build steps.

You are now ready to start configuring these.
